  ### A bit about me

  I moved to Madrid, around 11 years ago and have been working in the Web Development and Content industry for all of that time. I have developed a data-first approach to how we use and write content, focusing on demographic data and information to help tailor relevant content to the people who want it.

  I believe success comes in communication and working together, putting the value and success of a company above specific departments.

Post COVID, I actually have started a family, and recently became a dad, so I am currently experiencing all the joys that come with not sleeping!

  ### Skills and knowledge

  I am very adept with Photoshop and front-end development, with experience in Indepth Competitor/User Research, Localisation and LQA, Hiring and Coaching.

More recently, I've dove headfirst into the world of Web3 and UI design, with Figma becoming my main tool for prototyping and creation.


  ### About this site

  Focusing more on JAMstack development, this site is a testament to my front-end abilities. To build this site I used Hugo (The engine), Forestry.io (CMS), Netlify (DNS and Build), GitHub (Hosting).
