HTMLcontent: "Picture of me to come soon..\n\n### A bit about me\n\nI moved to Madrid,
  around 7 years ago and have been working in the Web Development and Content industry
  for all of that time. I have developed a data-first approach to how we use and write
  content, focusing on demographic data and information to help tailor relevant content
  to the people who want it.\n\nI believe success comes in communication and working
  together, putting the value and success of a company above specific departments.
  \n\n### Skills and knowledge\n\nI am very adept with Photoshop and front-end development,
  with experience in Indepth Competitor/User Research, Localisation and LQA, Hiring
  and Coaching. \n\nTools I have used in regularly include Google Analytics, Search
  Console, WordPress,  Upwork and Fiverr. In addition to WordPress, I frequently tailored
  certain CSS aspects of the theme I bought, in order to make things feel more tailored.\n\n###
  About this site\n\nFocusing more on JAMstack development, this site is a testament
  to my front-end abilities. To build this site I used Hugo (The engine), Forestry.io
  (CMS), Netlify (DNS and Build), GitHub (Hosting). "
