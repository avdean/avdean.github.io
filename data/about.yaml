  ### A bit about me

  I moved to Madrid, around 7 years ago and have been working in the Web Development and Content industry for all of that time. I have developed a data-first approach to how we use and write content, focusing on demographic data and information to help tailor relevant content to the people who want it.

  I believe success comes in communication and working together, putting the value and success of a company above specific departments.

  ### Skills and knowledge

  I am very adept with Photoshop and front-end development, with experience in Indepth Competitor/User Research, Localisation and LQA, Hiring and Coaching.

  Tools I have used in regularly include Google Analytics, Search Console, WordPress,  Upwork and Fiverr. In addition to WordPress, I frequently tailored certain CSS aspects of the theme I bought, in order to make things feel more tailored.

  ### About this site

  Focusing more on JAMstack development, this site is a testament to my front-end abilities. To build this site I used Hugo (The engine), Forestry.io (CMS), Netlify (DNS and Build), GitHub (Hosting).
