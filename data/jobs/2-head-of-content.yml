content: "At Hellotickets, a startup with a mission to become the Booking.com of experiences, I played a pivotal role in defining the company's brand voice, tone, and core values as the Content Manager. Starting with a small team of six and an external development team, I worked closely with key stakeholders to craft compelling content that resonated with our target audience.

As the company gained traction and began to expand, I was instrumental in driving the growth of our NBA ticket sales and repositioning the platform as a destination for travel experiences. With the team size growing to 15 members, I took on a leadership role, mentoring and coaching a team member to ensure consistent quality and voice across all content channels.

Looking to drive long-term success, I spearheaded the development of a sister blog focused on SEO to complement our ticket-selling platform. Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated travel restrictions led to my departure from the company in early 2020.

My experience at Hellotickets provided me with invaluable insights into the startup ecosystem and honed my skills in content strategy, team leadership, and brand building. I am eager to leverage these skills in my next role and drive success for my future employer."
