content: "<p>Hellotickets is a startup company, with a vision to be the Booking.com
  of experiences (both travel and entertainment), relying on a multitude of inventory
  via API integrations.</p><p>When I joined Hellotickets, we were a team of 6 people
  in a small office, with an external team of developers located in Russia. My role
  involved taking on the core responsibilities around Content, I helped to define
  the company's Voice, Tone and Core Values. In the following year, the company grew
  exponentially, as we began to gain traction selling NBA tickets, marketing the platform
  as a place for travel experiences. With growth on the horizon, our team then grew
  to 15 people, and I had my own team member to coach.</p><p>By the end of 2019, plans
  were put in place to build out a sister blog relying on long-term SEO, to help drive
  conversions to Hellotickets. Unfortunately, due to the Coronavirus breakout, and
  ensuing lockdowns and travel restrictions in early 2020, I was laid off.</p>"
