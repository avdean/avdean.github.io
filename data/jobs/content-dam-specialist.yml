content: "<p>Radisson Hotel Groups is a franchise of hotels with over 800+ hotels
  under their banner.</p><p>As the job title suggests I actually currently handle
  the content and imagery of all Radisson hotels and any digital assets necessary
  for the team. Along with our UX expert, I create Figma prototypes of solutions and
  suggestions on improvements to the site, along with actively working alongside our
  developer consultancy firm to make sure the changes we ask for are the changes we
  get.<br><br>On the content side, I help oversee the enhancements of the site, using
  JIRA to communicate with the developer team, using Excel extensively to make batch
  changes where necessary, as well as make life easier for the rest of the team in
  helping to organize content. We also use Workfront in order to handle direct requests
  from the various hotels and make the edits to their specific hotel.<br><br>Regarding
  imagery, while hotels can suggest imagery additions, final image curation of the
  hotels are down to me and the rest of my team, to make sure a certain level of quality
  is adhered to.</p>"
