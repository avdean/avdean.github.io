content: "Radisson Hotel Groups is a franchise of hotels with over 800+ hotels under their banner.
  
  As the job title suggests I actually currently handlE the experience and imagery of all Radisson hotels and any digital assets necessary
  for the team. Along with our UX expert, I create Figma prototypes of solutions and
  suggestions on improvements to the site, along with actively working alongside our
  developer consultancy firm to make sure the changes we ask for are the changes we
  get.
  
  On the experience side, I help oversee the enhancements of the site,
  including overseeing new projects to help elevate the digital experience of Radisson
  Hotel Groups. Two of our biggest projects includes setting up a no-code internal
  site, that can be leveraged by the rest of the team to take over traditional reporting,
  while the other is a complete redesign and introduction of a design system to replace
  the current site's design.
  
  Regarding imagery, while hotels can suggest imagery
  additions, final image curation of the hotels are down to me and the rest of my
  team, to make sure a certain level of quality is adhered to."
