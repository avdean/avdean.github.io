content: "<p>As the Experience and Imagery Manager at Radisson Hotel Groups, I am responsible for driving the digital experience of over 800 hotels under our banner. Working closely with our UX expert, I lead the creation of Figma prototypes and provide suggestions for site improvements to enhance the user experience.</p>
<p>In addition, I oversee the development of new projects to elevate the digital experience of Radisson Hotel Groups, including the implementation of a no-code internal site to streamline reporting and a complete redesign of the website using a new design system. These initiatives have been instrumental in improving the overall digital experience for our customers and increasing engagement on the website.</p>
<p>As the final curator of hotel imagery, I ensure that only high-quality visuals are showcased on our site, while also collaborating with hotels to suggest new imagery additions.
