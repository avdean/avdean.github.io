    "<p>To deal with an increase of demand from the UK market, alongside an increase of demand from our growing Partnership department, I was promoted to UK + Intl. Partnership Content Coordinator. My role's main objective is to facilitate and coordinate the needs of both entities to my department, Organic Growth.</p><p>A role essentially split into two, the partnership side involves connecting the Partnership team to our Content Specialists, designating more complicated asks to the various product departments that StubHub has, our design team, our SEO team, and the Localisation team. In a sense, it is my job to ensure each partnership's on-page treatment goes as smoothly as possible.</p>"
