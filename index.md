            <p class="light">I am not one to wax lyrical about my knowledge and skills, hopefully through this website you can glean enough of my personality shining through. All I will say is I am confident at what I do, yet never the type to brag or gloat. I like to
              help and support whenever I can.</p>

            <h5 class="center">A Tinkerer</h5>
            <p class="light">As you can tell from the website, I like to tinker, alot. This leads me to learn new technologies rapidly, with new skills acquired at every opportunity. There are of course things I would love to learn, UX Design for example, being one of
              the highest skills on my bucket list.</p>

            <h5 class="center">Social Media Free (Mostly)</h5>
            <p class="light">I have made a point of trying to lead a life free of social media such as Facebook and Twitter. While I know this leads many to see me as old, weird and not with-it, it's allowed me to keep an objective perspective regarding many topics. I
              do love a bit of reddit though.</p>
