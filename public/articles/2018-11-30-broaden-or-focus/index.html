<div class="post-content-body">
<p>Since building this website and then sharing it with some colleagues and friends, one thing was brought to my attention above everything else.</p>
<p>The website was far too broad with readers failing to find the main point that I was trying to get across.</p>
<p>This makes sense, as this is pretty much something I battle in every day life. In trying to be good at everything, I would find myself either stretching myself too thinly or finishing once satisfied with my own level (which can sometimes be almost impossible in itself or simply put lazily defined).</p>
<p>Obviously, nobody likes to be stretched and eternally unsatisfied, so this raised the question of whether it&rsquo;s better to be a <em>good at many things</em> or <em>amazing at one thing</em>. Now, I&rsquo;m too far gone to be amazing at one thing and I also believe that especially in this day and age, it takes both dedication and drive to be truly amazing and shine above everyone else.</p>
<p>After that you are putting yourself in a very vulnerable position of only offering the world that one skill, even though you&rsquo;re amazing at it.</p>
<h3 id="be-great-at-specific-things">Be great at specific things</h3>
<p>I still like and agree with the Jack-of-all-trades approach to life, but definitely can see that there&rsquo;s also not much call for the guy who can fix LG air-conditioners AND give expert legal advice for the patent office.</p>
<p>So with that in mind I decided to use this website as a way of trying to focus on one particular aspect and that is web design and setup, while offering extra services on the side in the <a href="/services" title="Services">Services</a> part.</p>
<p>This page is all very much work in progress since I&rsquo;m not even sure what or how I want to begin offering to folks.</p>
<h3 id="slight-ramble-ahead">Slight ramble ahead</h3>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve had a browse of the website, you&rsquo;ll probably notice in the <a href="/projects" title="Projects">Projects</a> page there is currently more photography than anything else.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s because there&rsquo;s a whopping 6 years in photography education and professional experience, followed by another 6 years doing it personally.</p>
<p>While I do really enjoy it, photography has always been something that I&rsquo;ve been wary of turning into a career since having worked as a cruise ship photographer. Admittedly, the website currently does come across as a bit of a compromise.</p>
<p>I should do away with my personal photography projects, they are also a part of me and I want to show that part.</p>
<p>Plus there&rsquo;s always been a tiny part of me that thinks that one day on my death-bed, all of my photos will be released to the world, and the world (along with my family) will mourn a great loss.</p>
<p>But everyone has that part right?</p>
