While my current job doesn't require the knowledge of HTML,  it's certainly helped. I know that part of this comes as part of the  territory (virtually any job in the digital sector). Depending on who  you ask, creating a website can fall into three categories:
<div class="card-panel grey lighten-4">
<ol>
<li>You can rely on a paid CMS such as WordPress.com, Squarespace, etc.  for an easy experience. which, depending on how much you spend be tailored exactly to your spec.</li>
<li>You can rely on a free CMS such as WordPress.org, Drupal, etc. for a limited amount of options. The downside is that and you'll end up paying for something else instead.</li>
<li>You can build it yourself, find the hosting and buy the domain.</li>
</ol>
	
<p>There's also a key different between WordPress.com and WordPress.org. which do with hosting and pricing. .Org is obviously free, however you'll have to find and pay for external hosting. .Com has different price levels, with the hosting covered. The downside is that if you want something unique, you'll also need to pay for a theme that you like.</p>
</div>
I went with the latter option. 
I already knew roughly how I wanted my site to look, and I didn't want to mess around with WordPress.
I once  helped my girlfriend's dad sort out his taxi website using WordPress. While I can admit that it's a fine platform and CMS. I couldn't quite customise it the way I wanted, and the amount of themes, pretty much, left me  paralyzed (I'm terrible with choice).   

Funny story about the taxi website site: 
<div class="card-panel grey lighten-4">
<p>Two weeks after I updated his information, he was soon "asked" to remove the site. By the way he tells it, it felt-like some sort of Taxi Mafia as their way of asking seemed to be more threatening in nature.</p>
<p>Suffice to say, I haven't really asked more about this. Obviously, it's not something I'd like to grill my soon-to-be-father-in-law about.</p>
</div>

In the end I decided it would be better to build the site from  scratch using a framework to help structure the pages.

 Originally I hadn't planned on having a blog at all, removing the need for dynamic content.  However it didn't seem right to look for content jobs, without showing  my own writing skills. Likewise it seems like a good way to instill some sort of personal consistency. 

I was also tired of  having to add my images and then manually tweak each HTML gallery, a downside to working with pure static sites. I have to admit, working dynamically certainly fixes that. (My next post will no doubt be in-depth look at moving to a dynamic system).

Having been a fan of where Material Design was going, I wanted  something that looked just as clean and could also work around a  specific structure. This is where Materialize CSS came in. I already had a good foundation of Bootstrap, due to work. What was great about Materialize CSS is that it works in a very similar fashion, except with the extra bells and whistles, that Material Design brings to the table.
