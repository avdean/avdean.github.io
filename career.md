               <p><strong>2017 - Current<br>UK + Intl. Partnership Content Coordinator</strong><br><em>Calle Don Ramon de la Cruz, 84, Madrid, Spain</em></p>
               <p style="font-size:85%">To deal with an increase of demand from the UK market, alongside an increase of demand from our growing Partnership department, I was promoted to UK + Intl. Partnership Content Coordinator. My role's main objective is to facilitate and coordinate the needs of both entities to my department, Organic Growth. A role essentially split into two, the partnership side involves connecting the Partnership team to our Content Specialists, designating more complicated asks to the various product departments that StubHub has, our design team, our SEO team, and the Localisation team. In a sense, it is my job to ensure each partnership's onpage treatment goes as smoothly as possible.</p>

               <p style="font-size:85%">In 2016, Ticketbis was bought by StubHub, (with itself standing as a sub-division of Ebay). With content editors being given clearer roles, and specialising countries futher, Content Specialists would actually handle Content, Catalogue and Localisation. Considering StubHub already had a UK office, with an entire Customer Service department based in Dublin, the workload demand and pressure to succeed grew higher. Working in both the Ticketbis CMS alongside StubHub's own, I began learning and using StubHub's CMS for both content and catalogue, with Worldserver and LQA testing standing as the new way to deal with translations and localisation. Having to represent the International team from the beginning, I took a much more active role regarding meetings with the UK office, especially when supporting our SEO team.</p>

               <p><strong>2013 - 2016<br>EN Content Manager</strong><br><em>Calle Don Ramon de la Cruz, 63, Madrid, Spain</em></p>
               <p style="font-size:85%">My role as Content Manager involved maintaining the UK blog, writing content for the site (both short and long form) and working with translation platforms such as Crowdin. I also maintained the home and landing pages of a number of English sites set in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. It was through maintaining these pages, where I first picked up working with HTML and the bootstrap framework. There was also occassions where I would create small images/logos for the pages, using photoshop. This also involved weekly meetings with Marketing Managers, where we collaborated on ways to improve the sites' visibility both through SEO and Marketing.</p>

               <p style="font-size:85%">My role with TSP stretched further than photographer. Along with photographing passengers, I spent a brief period as the main printer (Oriana), while near the end of my contract I was in charge of maintaining the ICT side of the photography department (Ventura). The role as well as being commission only, involved working at the highest standard of P&O, and as such, Customer Service and Salesmanship are both things I excel at. During my time with TSP I shot a total of 12 weddings, all of which I am very proud of.</p>
