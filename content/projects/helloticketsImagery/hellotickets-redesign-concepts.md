With the help of our product designer, these concepts were created to give credence to his ideas and plan for Hellotickets' imagery to represent each city or activity.  
Using stock and royalty-free imagery and Photoshop, the idea was to take the most iconic or recognizable feature of a city, and place that upon a preconceived solid background, that represented a general "type of activity".  
  
While the final images, proved to be much more simple affairs, here is where you can see the concept images of what could be possible using this method.
