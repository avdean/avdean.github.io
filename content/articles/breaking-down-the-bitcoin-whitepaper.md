With crypto currently in the zeitgeist again since 2018, I decided to actually read Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin whitepaper and do my long overdue.. due diligence. 

To help understand it, I figured it would be a fun exercise to try and laydown what exactly the bitcoin whitepaper basically says. 

To be honest, it's not a hugely difficult read, it's only 9 pages long, but it does get pretty technical by  7. 

So yeah, it's nice to have someone else's spark notes. 

So let's begin:

## The Abstract

So basically this is just Satoshi contextualising the whitepaper. He explain how a digital currency is possible, but the problem is something/someone is needed to prevent double spending. 

Thus he proposed bitcoin and it's proof-of-work method to counteract the double spend issue in a completely trustless manner. It gets a little technical here but basically he proposes a digital chain that keeps the original timestamp of a transaction within each instance. This in essence is the fundamentals of Blockchain technology.

It's easy to get bogged down at this point as he talks about hash rates, nodes and its reliance on CPU power, but the nutshell of it all is this:

The longer the chain the more secure it is.

## The introduction

With the abstract out of the way, Satoshi explains that the current issue with digital payment is that there's too much reliance on financial institutions and the trust based system.

He points ouy how truly non-reversible transactions can't really happen as there's always going to be a financial institute handling the mediation, in turn adding to the transaction cost and allowance of fraud. There is also the issue of merchants requiring more information from their buyers then necessary, because of the level of trust needed to accept payment from them.

He also rightly points out that if this was a physical currency, there'd be a direct exchange and none of these issues would exist.

And so we get to Satoshi's proposal: a currency based on cryptographical proof (read: stupidly complex) instead of trust. It's key characteristics being that there is no middleman for transactions, it's impractical to reverse (due to the computing power needed) and double spending is negated due to the whole chain and timestamp.
