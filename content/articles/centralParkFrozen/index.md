Two years ago, back in Christmas, we went to New York and experienced one of the whitest Christmas' imaginable. For a little context, I live in Spain and as you can probably tell by the date this has been published, the temperature is currently between hot and black-smith-furnace..

In a desperate attempt for some mental compensation and sheer nostalgia, I decided to a share a photo-essay of our trip in New York, specifically our visit to Central Park.

I also wanted to experiment extensively with Lightroom's colour tweaking, and figured a photo-essay would be the perfect way to try to develop a consistent scheme throughout. I know that the resulting images are a little on the fantastical side, I really like the finished results.
