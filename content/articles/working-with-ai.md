As you may have noticed, a few of my recent projects have come about from tinkering with Midjourney, an AI image generator, which has advanced ridiculously in the last few months. Now there are certainly issues regarding intellectual property, and understandably, AI image generation has taken centre stage in many artists rallying against the new technology. Personally I believe it will eventually fall into its own category of "Synthetic Art", whereby the prompt engineering itself, will be what is judged.

For those living under a rock, Artificial intelligence (AI) has come a long way, particularly in the realm of imagery and text. I've already spoken a little about Midjourney, but on the text side of things, a standout example of progress is ChatGPT, a powerful AI language model that has revolutionized the way we interact with machines.

One of the most interesting aspects of ChatGPT that I've been exploring is its ability to assume different personas. By providing it with a specific set of parameters, ChatGPT can take on the persona of any character you can imagine, whether it be a wise old man, a playful child, or a sarcastic teenager. This capability in itself, allows for a much more dynamic and engaging conversation with ChatGPT, as it can adapt to fit different scenarios and personalities, based on certain prompts.

Another way to I've been exploring ChatGPT is through the AI's ability to generate text adventure games on the fly. These interactive stories rely on the player's choices and actions to move the plot forward, and since the player can literally write whatever they want, ChatGPT can provides a unique and immersive experience as a virtual game master, simply by generating a relevant response. By guiding the player through the game world and reacting to their choices, ChatGPT can create a truly personalized gaming experience. .

Obviously there are some caveats, specifically regarding ChatGPT's safety filters and initial limitations, but it is possible to train ChatGPT within the chat thread itself, by providing it with specific responses and prompts. This in itself, is how it's possible to build personas or extend chatGPT's functionality beyond its initial training, as it can learn and adapt to your specific communication style and preferences, using certain specific prompts.

Needless to say there has been a significant advancement in AI, particularly in the fields of imagery and text, both areas in which my career has had a strong focus in. Instead of fearing the future however, I believe this is something to be embraced and utilized. It's not hard to see a shift from content creators becoming prompt engineers, since the same level of creativity is needed to train up an AI.
