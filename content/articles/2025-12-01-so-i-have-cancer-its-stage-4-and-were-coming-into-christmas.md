There's a lot to process and I will get into it.. it's rectal. I spent a year with the hope of a cure, however recently things have taken a turn for the wand despite surgery, the cancer went metastatic. 

I now survive with the unending care of my wife and my beautiful daughter, she's 3 pushing on 4 and I think I'll try my best to I represent how amazing they both are through this blog, and hopefully maybe I can claw back some level of recovery. 

I've just undergone the 4th chemo round it leaves me beyond tired and I know I would be sleeping but I wanted to know that this is still possible.
