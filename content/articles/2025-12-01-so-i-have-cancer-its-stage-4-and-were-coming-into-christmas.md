I now survive via the unending care of my wife and my beautiful daughter, she's 3 pushing on 4 and I'll try my best to I represent how amazing they both are, despite how easy it is to feel into the trap of being sad.

I underwent 4th chemo round and it left me beyond tired, and next week will be the beginning of the 5th.

It's been difficult because transitioning from stage 3 to stage 4 has resulted in a lot of "wait and see" and take it "day by day".. so I've been trying to keep myself busy and mostly building up strength with protein eating..

I'm also a tinkerer and part of that tinkering involves building a second blog (I have my own professional blog, though the vibe feels out of place all things).. it's easier writing these things when I know that nobody is actively reading it.

Anyway still kicking around for now, and if I get to building the second blog, that'll be one more win in my little projects, and I might try and figure out a way to get it easily exportable to substack as well.

I'm also going to try and focus on the photography a little more too, so I'll try to keep my original website open for that.
