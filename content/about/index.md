  ### About this site
  This website showcases my frontend development skills, with a focus on JAMstack development. I built it using Hugo as the engine, Netlify for DNS and Build, and GitHub for hosting. Additionally, it integrates a headless CMS, Decap CMS, to handle new content seamlessly.
  ### A bit about me
  As a web developer with over 11 years of experience in the industry, I have developed a data-first approach to content creation. My process is centered around demographic data and user research to deliver tailored and relevant content to users.

  My core values prioritize communication, teamwork, and putting the success of the company first. I have extensive experience in localisation, quality assurance, and competitor/user research. I am also adept in hiring and coaching to help build strong and productive teams.

  As a new father, I have a renewed appreciation for the importance of time management and prioritizing tasks efficiently. I am eager to leverage my skills and experience to contribute to a dynamic and thriving team.
  ### Skills and knowledge
  Recently, I have delved into Web3 and UI design, using Figma as my primary tool for prototyping and creation. I also have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with expertise in the React front-end framework. Furthermore, I have a gained a new passion for prompt engineering and tinkering with ChatGPT and MidJourney.
