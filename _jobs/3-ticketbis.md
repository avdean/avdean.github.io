My role as Content Manager involved maintaining the UK blog, writing content for the site (both short and long form) and working with translation platforms such as Crowdin. I also maintained the home and landing pages of a number of English sites set in the UK, Australia and New Zealand. 

It was through maintaining these pages, where I first picked up working with HTML and the bootstrap framework. There was also occassions where I would create small images/logos for the pages, using photoshop. This also involved weekly meetings with Marketing Managers, where we collaborated on ways to improve the sites' visibility both through SEO and Marketing.
