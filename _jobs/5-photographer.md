<p>My role with TSP stretched further than photographer. Along with photographing passengers, I spent a brief period as the main printer (Oriana), while near the end of my contract I was in charge of maintaining the ICT side of the photography department (Ventura).</p>
<p>The role as well as being commission only, involved working at the highest standard of P&O, and as such, Customer Service and Salesmanship are both things I excel at. During my time with TSP I shot a total of 12 weddings, all of which I am very proud of.</p>
