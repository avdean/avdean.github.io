In 2016, Ticketbis was bought by StubHub, (with itself standing as a sub-division of Ebay). With content editors being given clearer roles, and specialising countries futher, Content Specialists would actually handle Content, Catalogue and Localisation. Considering StubHub already had a UK office, with an entire Customer Service department based in Dublin, the workload demand and pressure to succeed grew higher. 

Working in both the Ticketbis CMS alongside StubHub's own, I began learning and using StubHub's CMS for both content and catalogue, with Worldserver and LQA testing standing as the new way to deal with translations and localisation. Having to represent the International team from the beginning, I took a much more active role regarding meetings with the UK office, especially when supporting our SEO team.
