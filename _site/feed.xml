&lt;p&gt;I mentioned this in my previous post, but moving to an SSG was a long time coming. 
I had already been looking at ways to work with more dynamic technologies, however everywhere I read wrote about how overkill it was to learn something like React or Ruby considering it was for a simple site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose that kind of made sense, in the same way, you wouldn’t use a blowtorch to light candles. (Don’t get me a wrong I still have plans to learn React, especially as I’ve heard good things about &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.com/&quot;&gt;Gatsby.js&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, as the site grew, the need for something dynamic became much more apparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, there’s been a lot of chatter regarding Static Site Generators (SSGs). Basically, an SSG creates a webpage in parts and does it before the user sees it (There are much more &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/building-a-jekyll-site-part-1-of-3/&quot;&gt;technical blogs&lt;/a&gt; that explain this in greater detail), but the point is that it’s supposed to be more secure, and easier to deal with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside is that you’re left without a standard CMS option, minus writing in Markdown, though I’ve also read that this has been remedied in newer SSGs and hosting pages (Netlify and Gatsby comes to mind here).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Better yet, it turned out to be surprisingly easy to pick up Jekyll; though there were a number of hurdles in the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;installing-jekyll&quot;&gt;Installing Jekyll&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unlike creating HTML from scratch, you can’t simply open the HTML page when finished (because it’s not actually constructed yet). You need Jekyll (and in a sense Ruby) in order to run on your system, to do the constructing to see your finished page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve read that it CAN be difficult installing Jekyll on Windows, but it was a breeze getting it working on Linux since it was a simple case of installing all the dependancies via the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-command-line&quot;&gt;The Command Line&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’re not comfortable navigating the command line, it can be a little daunting. 
Fortunately, there’s not much call for it once you’ve installed Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing you need to do is &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; (change directory) to the folder holding your website via the terminal (or easier yet, open the folder in a terminal directly.) Once there, you can either type in the terminal: &lt;code&gt;Jekyll build&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short explanation here:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;code&gt;build&lt;/code&gt;: builds the site in the _site folder, while &lt;code&gt;serve&lt;/code&gt; build’s the site on a server offline and displays it on the URL: localhost:4000.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it’s direct, &lt;code&gt;Jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt; does the job quite nicely and you can check your changes live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;way-of-thinking&quot;&gt;Way of Thinking&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know how your CSS exists in a file, your javascript exists in another file and you reference it all in your HTML page. SSG’s are pretty much an extension of this, dividing the entire HTML code into digestible snippets, depending on what you need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two main versions of this, _Layouts and _Includes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_Layouts is where the default stuff lives, you would place code here that is unlikely to change at all, eg.  &lt;code&gt; &amp;lt; head &amp;gt; &lt;/code&gt; elements, &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt; link rel=&quot;&quot; &amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; codes and your &lt;code&gt;script&lt;/code&gt; codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_Includes is where you put repetitive elements that you might not want to include on every single page, but will make your life easier &lt;code&gt; &amp;lt; header &amp;gt;, &amp;lt; footer &amp;gt; &lt;/code&gt; elements come to mind a lot here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The great thing is that there are no set rules on how this is done and you can code this part however you find easiest. The biggest plus is this; let’s say you have 6 different pages and you’ve added a 7th, you only need to change the header and footer elements once (found in the _Includes) folder in order For the change to be applied to your entire website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a pretty nice deal all things considered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;yaml-and-liquid&quot;&gt;YAML and Liquid&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://yaml.org/&quot;&gt;YAML&lt;/a&gt; is the language that Jekyll uses in order to actually read to your files and fortunately it’s a pretty easy language to understand, you pretty much define your points in a file called config.yml and that lives in your root folder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also Liquid, which is a templating language and that’s how Jekyll calls in your HTML snippets, and even allows for certain conditionals so there’s a dynamic element to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a better explanation, definitely check out &lt;a href=&quot;https://shopify.github.io/liquid/basics/introduction&quot;&gt;Liquid’s Official Documentation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this dynamic nature, it also means that Jekyll handles blog posts with just as much ease, though initially trying to get it to work first-time took a lot of abstract thinking since you need to understand how &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;for loops&lt;/code&gt; work which is very much in scripting territory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I’m still getting to grips with how Jekyll can work, I wouldn’t feel comfortable writing a proper how-to on setting up a simple page, however, coupled with a basic framework system I can image it can be pretty easy building out a boilerplate page.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="SSG" /><category term="HTML Code" /><category term="Jekyll" /><summary type="html">unsplash-logoAustin Chan</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmw0znxgj/image/upload/c_scale,w_1000/v1541954989/signs.jpg" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Wordpress or HTML</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/11/05/WordPress-or-HTML.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Wordpress or HTML" /><published>2018-11-05T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2018-11-05T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/11/05/WordPress-or-HTML</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/11/05/WordPress-or-HTML.html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;background-color:black;color:white;text-decoration:none;padding:4px 6px;font-family:-apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &amp;quot;San Francisco&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Helvetica Neue&amp;quot;, Helvetica, Ubuntu, Roboto, Noto, &amp;quot;Segoe UI&amp;quot;, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:12px;font-weight:bold;line-height:1.2;display:inline-block;border-radius:3px&quot; href=&quot;https://unsplash.com/@halgatewood?utm_medium=referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=photographer-credit&amp;amp;utm_content=creditBadge&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener noreferrer&quot; title=&quot;Download free do whatever you want high-resolution photos from Hal Gatewood&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px&quot;&gt;&lt;svg xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&quot; style=&quot;height:12px;width:auto;position:relative;vertical-align:middle;top:-1px;fill:white&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 32 32&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;unsplash-logo&lt;/title&gt;&lt;path d=&quot;M20.8 18.1c0 2.7-2.2 4.8-4.8 4.8s-4.8-2.1-4.8-4.8c0-2.7 2.2-4.8 4.8-4.8 2.7.1 4.8 2.2 4.8 4.8zm11.2-7.4v14.9c0 2.3-1.9 4.3-4.3 4.3h-23.4c-2.4 0-4.3-1.9-4.3-4.3v-15c0-2.3 1.9-4.3 4.3-4.3h3.7l.8-2.3c.4-1.1 1.7-2 2.9-2h8.6c1.2 0 2.5.9 2.9 2l.8 2.4h3.7c2.4 0 4.3 1.9 4.3 4.3zm-8.6 7.5c0-4.1-3.3-7.5-7.5-7.5-4.1 0-7.5 3.4-7.5 7.5s3.3 7.5 7.5 7.5c4.2-.1 7.5-3.4 7.5-7.5z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:inline-block;padding:2px 3px&quot;&gt;Hal Gatewood&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While my current job doesn’t require the knowledge of HTML,  it’s certainly helped. I know that part of this comes as part of the  territory (virtually any job in the digital sector). Depending on who  you ask, creating a website can fall into three categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;card-panel grey lighten-4&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can rely on a paid CMS such as WordPress.com, Squarespace, etc.  for an easy experience. which, depending on how much you spend be tailored exactly to your spec.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can rely on a free CMS such as WordPress.org, Drupal, etc. for a limited amount of options. The downside is that and you'll end up paying for something else instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can build it yourself, find the hosting and buy the domain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
	
&lt;p&gt;There's also a key different between WordPress.com and WordPress.org. which do with hosting and pricing. .Org is obviously free, however you'll have to find and pay for external hosting. .Com has different price levels, with the hosting covered. The downside is that if you want something unique, you'll also need to pay for a theme that you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I went with the latter option. 
I already knew roughly how I wanted my site to look, and I didn’t want to mess around with WordPress.
I once  helped my girlfriend’s dad sort out his taxi website using WordPress. While I can admit that it’s a fine platform and CMS. I couldn’t quite customise it the way I wanted, and the amount of themes, pretty much, left me  paralyzed (I’m terrible with choice).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny story about the taxi website site:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;card-panel grey lighten-4&quot;&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two weeks after I updated his information, he was soon &quot;asked&quot; to remove the site. By the way he tells it, it felt-like some sort of Taxi Mafia as their way of asking seemed to be more threatening in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suffice to say, I haven't really asked more about this. Obviously, it's not something I'd like to grill my soon-to-be-father-in-law about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end I decided it would be better to build the site from  scratch using a framework to help structure the pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally I hadn’t planned on having a blog at all, removing the need for dynamic content.  However it didn’t seem right to look for content jobs, without showing  my own writing skills. Likewise it seems like a good way to instill some sort of personal consistency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was also tired of  having to add my images and then manually tweak each HTML gallery, a downside to working with pure static sites. I have to admit, working dynamically certainly fixes that. (My next post will no doubt be in-depth look at moving to a dynamic system).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having been a fan of where Material Design was going, I wanted  something that looked just as clean and could also work around a  specific structure. This is where Materialize CSS came in. I already had a good foundation of Bootstrap, due to work. What was great about Materialize CSS is that it works in a very similar fashion, except with the extra bells and whistles, that Material Design brings to the table.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="Materialize CSS" /><category term="Web Design" /><category term="Jekyll" /><summary type="html">unsplash-logoHal Gatewood</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://res.cloudinary.com/dmw0znxgj/image/upload/c_scale,w_1000/v1541436045/html_boxes.jpg" /></entry></feed>
